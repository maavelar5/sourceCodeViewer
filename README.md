config file should look like this.

```
x:0
y:0
w:1920
h:1080
file:main.c
fullScreen:1
logicalW:1920
logicalH:1080
font:font.ttf
fontSize:28
# sfx:typing.wav
```

- file is the absolute path to the file you want to display
- font is the absolute path to the font you want to use
- logicalW & logicalH will resize the output of the render to those values
